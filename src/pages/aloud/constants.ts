export const text = `On the first day of the holiday, I decided to go on a hiking trip with my friends. We packed our backpacks with snacks and water, and set off early in the morning. The fresh air, beautiful scenery, and the sound of birds chirping made the hike enjoyable. When we reached the mountain top, we were rewarded with breathtaking views and a sense of accomplishment.

The second day was a day for relaxation and leisure. I spent the day at home, reading a good book, listening to music, and just enjoying some quiet time. It was a much-needed break from the hustle and bustle of daily life.

On the final day of the holiday, I visited a local museum. I was fascinated by the exhibits showcasing the history and culture of our region. I learned about the traditions and customs of the past, and gained a deeper appreciation for our heritage.

Overall, my May Day holiday was a perfect blend of adventure, relaxation, and learning. It was a time to recharge, connect with friends, and appreciate the beauty of the world around me. I look forward to creating more wonderful memories during the next May Day holiday.`;
